        <div class="box box1"><h3>Java</h3><P>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</P></div>
        <div class="box box2"><h3>Applet</h3><p>Java applets were programs that were embedded in other applications, typically in a Web page displayed in a web browser. The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java 9 in 2017.</p></div>
        <div class="box box3"><h3>Class libraries</h3><p>The Java Class Library is the standard library, developed to support application development in Java. It is controlled by Oracle in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program. Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy during the 2010s. he class library contains features such as:
          The core libraries, which include:
          IO/NIO
          Networking (NOTE: new HTTP Client since Java 11)
          Reflection
          Concurrency
          Generics
          Scripting/Compiler
          Functional programming (Lambda, Streaming)
          Collection libraries that implement data structures such as lists, dictionaries, trees, sets, queues and double-ended queue, or stacks
          XML Processing (Parsing, Transforming, Validating) libraries
          Security
          Internationalization and localization libraries</p></div>
        <div class="box box4"><h3>Implementations</h3><p>Oracle Corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Microsoft Windows (still works for XP, while only later versions are currently officially supported), macOS, Linux, and Solaris.</p></div>
        <div class="box box5"><h3>History</h3><p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. </p></div>
        <div class="box box6"><h3>Swing application</h3><p>Swing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for macOS.</p></div>
