        <div class="box box1"><h3>C</h3><p>C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly</p> </div>
        <div class="box box2"><h3>Pointers</h3><p>C supports the use of pointers, a type of reference that records the address or location of an object or function in memory. Pointers can be dereferenced to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function.</p></div>
        <div class="box box3"><h3>Arrays</h3><p>Array types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time. The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays.</p></div>
        <div class="box box4"><h3>Libraries</h3><p>The C programming language uses libraries as its primary method of extension. In C, a library is a set of functions contained within a single "archive" file. Each library typically has a header file, which contains the prototypes of the functions contained within the library that may be used by a program, and declarations of special data types and macro symbols used with these functions</p></div>
        <div class="box box5"><h3>History</h3><p>The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a PDP-7 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. </p></div>
        <div class="box box6"><h3>Syntax</h3><p>C has a formal grammar specified by the C standard. Line endings are generally not significant in C; however, line boundaries do have significance during the preprocessing phase. </p></div>
        <div class="box box7"><h3>Reserved words</h3><p>C89 has 32 reserved words, also known as keywords, which are the words that cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined:auto, break, case, char, const, continue, default, do </p></div>
