        <div class="box box1"><h3>SQL</h3><p>Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL  is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS)</p></div>
        <div class="box box2"><h3>Syntax</h3><p>The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including: Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow. Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.</p></div>
        <div class="box box3"><h3>Procedural extensions</h3><p>SQL is designed for a specific purpose: to query data contained in a relational database. SQL is a set-based, declarative programming language, not an imperative programming language like C or BASIC. However, extensions to Standard SQL add procedural programming.</p></div>
        <div class="box box4"><h3>Interoperability and standardization</h3><p>SQL implementations are incompatible between vendors and do not necessarily completely follow standards. In particular, date and time syntax, string concatenation, NULLs, and comparison case sensitivity vary from vendor to vendor.</p></div>
        <div class="box box5"><h3>SQL data types</h3><p>The SQL standard defines three kinds of data types 
          predefined data types
          constructed types
          user-defined types.
          Constructed types are one of ARRAY, MULTISET, REF(erence), or ROW. User-defined types are comparable to classes in object-oriented language with their own constructors, observers, mutators, methods, inheritance, overloading, overwriting, interfaces.</p></div>
        <div class="box box6"><h3>History</h3><p>QL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Edgar F. Codd[12] in the early 1970s. This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM.</p></div>
        <div class="box box7"><h3>Importance</h3><p>Structured query language (SQL) is a popular query language that is frequently used in all types of applications. Data analysts and developers learn and use SQL because it integrates well with different programming languages. For example, they can embed SQL queries.</p></div>
        <div class="box box8"><h3>Criticisms</h3><p>SQL deviates in several ways from its theoretical foundation, the relational model and its tuple calculus. In that model, a table is a set of tuples, while in SQL, tables and query results are lists of rows; the same row may occur multiple times, and the order of rows can be employed in queries (e.g. in the LIMIT clause).</p></div>
