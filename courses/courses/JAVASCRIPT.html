        <div class="box box1"><h3>JavaScript</h3><p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.</p></div>
        <div class="box box2"><h3>Syntax</h3><p>There is no built-in Input/output functionality in JavaScript, instead it is provided by the run-time environment. The ECMAScript specification in edition 5.1 mentions that "there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results". <br><br>An anonymous function (or lambda):const counter = function() {
          let count = 0;
          return function() {
              return ++count;
          }
      }; </p></div>
        <div class="box box3"><h3>Object-orientation (prototype-based)</h3><p>You make prototype objects, and then make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects.</p></div>
        <div class="box box4"><h3>Functional</h3><p>JavaScript functions are first-class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind(). A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. </p></div>
        <div class="box box5"><h3>Security</h3><p>JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions.</p></div>
        <div class="box box6"><h3>History</h3><p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people.</p></div>
        <div class="box box7"><h3>Browser and plugin coding errors</h3><p>JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application.</p></div>
