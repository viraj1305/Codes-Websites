        <div class="box box1"><h3>C++</h3><p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p></div>
        <div class="box box2"><h3>Object storage</h3><p>As in C, C++ supports four types of memory management: static storage duration objects, thread storage duration objects, automatic storage duration objects, and dynamic storage duration objects.</p></div>
        <div class="box box3"><h3>Templates</h3><p>C++ templates enable generic programming. C++ supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by instantiation at compile-time. </p></div>
        <div class="box box4"><h3>Objects</h3><p>C++ introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) features to C. It offers classes, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p></div>
        <div class="box box5"><h3>Operators and operator overloading</h3><p>C++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be overloaded for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access</p></div>
        <div class="box box6"><h3>Lambda expressions</h3><p>C++ provides support for anonymous functions, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form: [capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body }</p></div>
        <div class="box box7"><h3>Exception handling</h3><p>Exception handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled.[75] It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors.</p></div>
        <div class="box box8"><h3>History</h3><p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.[20] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis.</p></div>
        <div class="box box9"><h3>Standardization</h3><p>C++ is standardized by an ISO working group known as JTC1/SC22/WG21. So far, it has published six revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working on the next revision, C++23.</p></div>
